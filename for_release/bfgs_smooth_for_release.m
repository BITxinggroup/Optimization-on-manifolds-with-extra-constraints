% function [x, cost, info, options] = rlbfgs(problem)
% function [x, cost, info, options] = rlbfgs(problem, x0)
% function [x, cost, info, options] = rlbfgs(problem, x0, options)
% function [x, cost, info, options] = rlbfgs(problem, [], options)
%
%
% This is Riemannian Limited memory BFGS solver (quasi-Newton method), 
% which aims to minimize the cost function in problem structure problem.cost. 
% It needs gradient of the cost function. There is an filed in options called
% options.memory to specifiy the memory size (number of iteration that the 
% algorithm remembers), and for non-limited memory, simply put options.memory = Inf
%
%
% For a description of the algorithm and theorems offering convergence
% guarantees, see the references below.
%
% The initial iterate is x0 if it is provided. Otherwise, a random point on
% the manifold is picked. To specify options whilst not specifying an
% initial iterate, give x0 as [] (the empty matrix).
%
% The two outputs 'x' and 'cost' are the last reached point on the manifold
% and its cost. 
% 
% The output 'info' is a struct-array which contains information about the
% iterations:
%   iter (integer)
%       The iteration number, or number of steps considered
%       (whether accepted or rejected). The initial guess is 0.
%	cost (double)
%       The corresponding cost value.
%	gradnorm (double)
%       The (Riemannian) norm of the gradient.
%	time (double)
%       The total elapsed time in seconds to reach the corresponding cost.
%	stepsize (double)
%       The size of the step from the previous to the new iterate.
%   accepted (boolean)
%       1 if the current step is accepted in the cautious update. 0 otherwise
%   And possibly additional information logged by options.statsfun.
% For example, type [info.gradnorm] to obtain a vector of the successive
% gradient norms reached at each (outer) iteration.
%
% The options structure is used to overwrite the default values. All
% options have a default value and are hence optional. To force an option
% value, pass an options structure with a field options.optionname, where
% optionname is one of the following and the default value is indicated
% between parentheses:
%
%   tolgradnorm (1e-6)
%       The algorithm terminates if the norm of the gradient drops below
%       this. For well-scaled problems, a rule of thumb is that you can
%       expect to reduce the gradient norm by 8 orders of magnitude
%       (sqrt(eps)) compared to the gradient norm at a "typical" point (a
%       rough initial iterate for example). Further decrease is sometimes
%       possible, but inexact floating point arithmetic will eventually
%       limit the final accuracy. If tolgradnorm is set too low, the
%       algorithm may end up iterating forever (or at least until another
%       stopping criterion triggers).
%   maxiter (1000)
%       The algorithm terminates if maxiter iterations were executed.
%   maxtime (Inf)
%       The algorithm terminates if maxtime seconds elapsed.
%   minstepsize (1e-10)
%     The minimum norm of the tangent vector that points from the current
%     point to the next point. If the norm is less than minstepsize, the 
%     program will terminate.
%   memory (30)
%     The number of previous iterations the program remembers in LBFGS. This is used 
%     to approximate the Hessian at the current point. Because of difficulty
%     of maintaining a representation of hessian in terms of coordinates, and
%     thus a recursive computation for the direction pointing to the next
%     point is done by considering approximating Hessian as an operator that takes
%     a vector and outputs a vector in the tangent space. Theoretically, a
%     vector recurse back memory size number of times and thus memory size 
%     is linear with the time taken to compute directions towards the next
%     point.
%     It can take any value >= 0, or Inf (which will then take value options.maxiter. If
%     options.maxiter has value Inf, then it will take value 10000 with
%     warning displayed).
%   linesearch (@linesearch_hint)
%       Function handle to a line search function. The options structure is
%       passed to the line search too, so you can pass it parameters. See
%       each line search's documentation for info.
%       By default, the intial multiplier tried is alpha = 1. This can be changed
%       with options.linesearch: see the documentation of linesearch_hint.
%   strict_inc_func (@(x) x)
%     The Cautious step needs a real function that has value 0 at x = 0, and 
%     strictly increasing. See details in Wen Huang's paper
%     "A Riemannian BFGS Method without Differentiated Retraction for 
%     Nonconvex Optimization Problems
%   statsfun (none)
%       Function handle to a function that will be called after each
%       iteration to provide the opportunity to log additional statistics.
%       They will be returned in the info struct. See the generic Manopt
%       documentation about solvers for further information. statsfun is
%       called with the point x that was reached last, after the
%       accept/reject decision. See comment below.
%   stopfun (none)
%       Function handle to a function that will be called at each iteration
%       to provide the opportunity to specify additional stopping criteria.
%       See the generic Manopt documentation about solvers for further
%       information.
%   verbosity (2)
%       Integer number used to tune the amount of output the algorithm
%       generates during execution (mostly as text in the command window).
%       The higher, the more output. 0 means silent. 3 and above includes a
%       display of the options structure at the beginning of the execution.
%   debug (false)
%       Set to true to allow the algorithm to perform additional
%       computations for debugging purposes. If a debugging test fails, you
%       will be informed of it, usually via the command window. Be aware
%       that these additional computations appear in the algorithm timings
%       too, and may interfere with operations such as counting the number
%       of cost evaluations, etc. (the debug calls get storedb too).
%   storedepth (30)
%       Maximum number of different points x of the manifold for which a
%       store structure will be kept in memory in the storedb. If the
%       caching features of Manopt are not used, this is irrelevant. If
%       memory usage is an issue, you may try to lower this number.
%       Profiling may then help to investigate if a performance hit was
%       incurred as a result.
% 
%       For a comment about how the info struct-array and statsfun interact 
%       with the notion of accepted / rejected step, see the documention of 
%       trustregions.
